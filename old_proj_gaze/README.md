%% 
In every folder, there is a jupyter-notebook file, where dependencies and libraries are specified. Also, you can use it for training and just example inference. If datasets and weights are needed: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1Nhr8FbTBFPC_LHq7ZDRiwWwxtPHqK_oL?usp=sharing

%% 
In the celeba folder, there is jupyter-notebook, where the model for eye localization is specified, which is the first part. In the end, there is an example of inference.

%% 
In the eye_gaze folder, there is jupyter-notebook, where the updated ViT model was constructed. Also, training on UnityEyes specified. Inference example at the end. Working with the only dataset, we took some parts from here: https://github.com/david-wb/gaze-estimation/blob/249691893a37944a03e4ad4a3448083b6f63af10/datasets/unity_eyes.py
